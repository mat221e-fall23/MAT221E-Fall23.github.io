However, weekly class schedules are subject to change depending on the progress we make as a class.\n\nCounting methods, combinatorial methods, product rule, permutation, combination, binomial expansion, multinomial expansion, tree diagram.\nAxioms of probability and related corollaries (with proofs).\nConditional probability, multiplication rule, independent of events, extension to multiple events.\n\nBayes’ theorem and the law of total probability.\nRandom variables, distributions and probability mass functions, cumulative distribution function.\n\nExpectation, variance, moment generating functions (MGF).\nSpecial discrete distributions: Bernoulli, Binomial distributions, Poisson, Geometric, Negative Binomial, Hypergeometric, and discrete uniform distributions. Expectation, variance, and MGF of these distributions.\nContinuous random variables: Probability density functions, Uniform, Exponential, Gamma, Normal, Standard Normal distributions. Expectation, variance, and MGF of these distributions.\nJoint distributions: Joint, marginal, and conditional distributions. Marginal and conditional density functions, independent random variables.\nTransformations: Change of variables, convolutions\n\n\n\n\n\nA student who completed this course successfully is expected to:\n\n\nUnderstand and apply basic concepts of probability.\n\n\nUnderstand probability distributions for both discrete and continuous phenomena.\n\n\nCalculate basic characteristics such as mean and variance of probability distributions, and any probability associated with this distributions.\n\n\nUse special probability distributions for modeling events.\n\n\nUse limit theorems.\n\n\nimmediately following the course, and/or a few months after the course.\n\n\n\n\nAll lecture materials. Lecture notes will not be uploaded to Ninova.\n\n\n\n2 quizzes, 1 midterm exam, and 1 final exam (see the grading policy below).\n\n\n\n\nStudents are encouraged to consult the following sources on their own:\n\n\nDeGroot., M.H. and Schervish, M.J.
